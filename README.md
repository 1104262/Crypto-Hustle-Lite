# Crypto-Hustle-Lite

## Overview and Features

Crypto Hustle is an application that provides information about various cryptocurrencies through the use of API calls. Users can also search for a specific currency using the search bar feature. Some of the key features of Crypto Hustle include the ability to create an API key and read the API documentation to understand how to make requests. The app uses the useEffect() hook as a replacement for previous mount/unmount functions and fetches API data using async/await syntax. Props are used to send variable data to a component for use in a variety of use cases. Additionally, the app utilizes conditional rendering, either with if statements or ternary operators, to display information on the page only when necessary and return to a default state if not. Finally, the app also practices the use of CSS to format pages.
