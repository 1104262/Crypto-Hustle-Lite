# Crypto-Hustle-Lite

## Overview

On My Grind is a quiz game for guessing the recipes of popular and unknown Starbucks drinks, built using React, Vite, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

### Gameplay

The game will generate a new drink order for you and ask you to compose it. You will have to memorize the drink recipes over time, selecting the correct option from four different categories: temperature, syrup flavor, milk type, and blended?. For example, if I receive a Hazelnut Oatmilk Latte, then my response should be hot, hazelnut, oat, no.
